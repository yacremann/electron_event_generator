To generator software projects:

1.) Synthesize the firmware! This will create the electron_event_generator.xsa file.

2.) <path to Vitis binaries/>xsct platform.tcl

3.) Create a directory outside this project for the Vitis workspace

4.) Start Vitis, use the new workspace directory

5.) File - Import - Eclipse Workspace
Select this directory as the root directory

6.) Build all

To program the flash memory:
in the workspace: go to the directory DldSimulator and run program_flash.sh
Caution: You may need to change the path to the Xilinx Vitis binaries!

I tried to remove all absolute paths, so please don't push any absolute paths into the reo!
