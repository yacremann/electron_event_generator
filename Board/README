Board files for the electron event generator:

The board is basicaly an adapter board for the Trenz Electronics TE0725-03-100-2C FPGA board.
The Trenz board goes "upside down" onto our "ElectronGenerator" board.
CAUTION: REMOVE R25 on the Trenz board as we supply 2.5V to the LVDS IO blocks!!

The HDMI-Connector is used to send the signal to the TDC (as specified by SurfaceConcept) whereas the SMA outputs are for measurements with an oscloscope.
